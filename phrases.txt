Aethina tumida adults are 5–7 mm long and 3–4.5 mm wide, are reddish brown or black in color, and have short, strong elytra (Neumann et al. 2013).
Adult beetles in the wild are thought to live up to six months (Pettis and Shimanuki 2000). However, it has been estimated that A. tumida adults in the laboratory could live up to 16 months, with female life-span dependent on egg laying frequency (Somerville 2003, Neumann et al. 2016).
Unfortunately, bumblebee (Bombus impatiens Cresson) colonies can also be alternate hosts for A. tumida, with one study revealing that A. tumida adults did not display preference between A. mellifera and B. impatiens colonies and that A. tumida females will oviposit in B. impatiens colonies (Hoffmann et al. 2008). Infestations of B. impatiens colonies, along with other potential A. tumida infestations of native pollinators and wild A. mellifera colonies, pose a risk to managed colonies, since infestation levels in the environments surrounding apiaries could become high without any intervention by apiarists until A. tumida is well established in that geographic range.
