Aethina tumida adults (Fig. 1) are 5–7 mm long and 3–4.5 mm wide, are reddish brown or black in color, and have short, strong elytra
Adult beetles in the wild are thought to live up to six months (Pettis and Shimanuki 2000). However, it has been estimated that A. tumida adults in the laboratory could live up to 16 months
Infestations of B. impatiens colonies, along with other potential A. tumida infestations of native pollinators and wild A. mellifera colonies, pose a risk to managed colonies, since infestation levels in the environments surrounding apiaries could become high
